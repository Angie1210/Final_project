# Final_project

* Topic: Direct Marketing

* We selected this topic because machine learning models can help improve direct marketing campaigns from the bank to target potential future customers

* The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. 

* The dataset we are using is bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs).

* The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.
